# Static-website-AWS
Deploying a static website on AWS in line with Udacity task 1 of the BIT and Udacity nanodegree program.

In this project I deployed a static website on AWS by uploading the files to the Amazon S3 bucket.
Then I configured Amazon cloudfront with the static bucket enpoint to enable low latency and faster distribution speeds.

Static website obtained from the project templates and modified by me.
